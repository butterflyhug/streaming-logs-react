Created with CodeSandbox

## Dependency install

Use your mechanism of choice to install Node and pnpm. Tested with:

- node 20 (CodeSandbox provides 20.12.1; I used 20.18.1 locally)
- pnpm 8 (CodeSandbox provides 8.15.6; I used 8.15.9 locally)

Then install JS/TS dependencies with `pnpm install`.

## Running the app for local development

Run `pnpm start` to run a development server at http://localhost:3000/. This
command will likely also automatically open the site in your default browser,
but if not, you can explicitly navigate to it.
